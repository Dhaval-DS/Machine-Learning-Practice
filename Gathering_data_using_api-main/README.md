# TMDB API Data Fetching Project

This project demonstrates how to fetch data from a public API using Python. The script retrieves data for top-rated TV shows from **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**, processes it, and saves it into a structured CSV file for further analysis.

-----

## Data Source

The data was sourced from the **[The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)**. Specifically, it uses the `tv/top_rated` endpoint. To run this project, you will need your own API key from the TMDB website.

-----

## Methodology

The script follows these steps to fetch and process the data:

1.  Sends an HTTP **`GET`** request to the TMDB API endpoint for top-rated TV shows.
2.  A loop is used to iterate through all available pages of the API results (113 pages in this case) to gather a comprehensive dataset.
3.  For each page, the JSON response is parsed, and the relevant data fields (**`id`**, **`name`**, **`origin_country`**, **`overview`**, **`popularity`**, **`vote_average`**, **`vote_count`**) are extracted into a **pandas DataFrame**.
4.  All individual DataFrames (one for each page) are concatenated into a single, master DataFrame.
5.  The final dataset is exported to a CSV file.

## Technologies Used ðŸ’»

  * **Python**
  * **Requests**: For making API calls.
  * **Pandas**: For data manipulation, creating DataFrames, and exporting to CSV.
  * **Jupyter Notebook**: As the development environment.

-----

## Output

The final output is a CSV file named **`top_rated_movies.csv`** containing **2256 rows and 7 columns**.
